ALGORITHM:
The algorithm is the for the process,
step 1: start
step 2: intialize the thread variables ,thread attributes ,semaphores as required
step 3: create the threads representing philosopher.
step 4: wait until the thread function execution.
Step 5: stop

The algorithm for the philosopher is,
step 1: Start
step 2: wait for the left fork
step 3: wait for the right fork
step 4:start eating
Step 5:release the left fork
Step 6:release the right fork
Step 7: Stop
