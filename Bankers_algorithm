ALGORITHM:

	step 1: start
	step 2: count=0
	step 3: Read the no :of process,p
	step 4: Read  the no :of resources,r
	step 5: Read  the max matrix for each process, max[i][j]
	step 6: Read  the allocation matrix for each process  ,alloc[i][j]
	step 7: Read  the available resource matrix ,avail[i][j]
	step 8 : Find the need matrix  ,need[i][j]
	step 9: For each incompleted process pi
		check whether need[i][j] < avail[i][j]
		if then allocate resources to the process
		increment Safe sequence
 	step 10: If safe sequence ==p then print safe state else unsafe state
	Step 11 : stop
